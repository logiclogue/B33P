# B33P

Good old hypothetical 8-bit machine.

The goal of this project has changed slightly. The original idea was to build an
8-bit machine. Now, it's a hypothetical gaming machine which is programmed in a
functional DSL.

## TO-DO

- Do the DDD approach, create all entities and start in a Beep folder
- Draw correct sprite depending on the time
    - Update the game state with the time
